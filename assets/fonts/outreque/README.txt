"Outreque" is a humanist sans serif family, following the natural flow of the handwriting. The original idea was to make a typeface with a quirky design. And that's when the handwriting curves come into play. The name "Outreque" was taken from the word "outré", which is defined as "very unusual".
The family introduces 9 weights with matching slants. Bolder weights can be used for logos, heading, titles, and subtitles, while lighter weights, which increase legibility, work best for longer texts.
